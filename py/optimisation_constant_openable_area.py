"""
Applying WWR variable in the "Calculated" natural ventilation mode
changes the openable area (as the area is represented as a percentage).

There may be cases when this approach is not suitable.

This script  modifies the "% Glazing Area Opens" for each WWR - to keep the
openable area constant (default 1m2).
